# Sprout of This World

## About

Sprout of This World is a web app that allows you to track information about plants around your house and in your garden. Information about your plants is stored in a database and displayed on the "My Plants" page. The app will set reminders for when to water your plants, depending on the type and location.

## Development

We wanted to create an app that could be used by anyone, beginner and master gardner alike. The database uses Express.js and Sequelize to store user info and plant info. Handlebars was used as a templating engine for the pages. 

## How to Use

The application can be used by downloading the code, and it is also deployed on Heroku.

Once the user signs up, several new pages become available. On the Inventory page, user will be able to add plants with information including: Plant Name, Plant Species, Location, Last watered, How often would you like to water etc...
It is from this information that user will get the alerts for watering displayed on the homepage.

## Future Development

Create a layout of the property that you are working on and the app can better help plan your plant schedule for the coming season or even the coming year.
Including measurements of space, soil type, and sunlight exposure for different areas of property.
Ability to connects to local nurseries.
Allow person to use scheduling application without logging in and eventually prompt the user to create log in so they get a taste of the app
Create 1 login but with the ability to add different users; like netflix
Resources on diagnosing plant disease.
